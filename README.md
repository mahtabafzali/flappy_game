 Flappy Bird – Python Game Project

This is a simple **Flappy Bird** game built using **Python** and the **Pygame** library. It was created as a learning project to practice game development concepts step by step.

 What the project does

This project is a playable version of the classic Flappy Bird game. The player controls a bird that jumps through gaps between moving pipes. If the bird touches the pipes or goes off-screen, the game ends. The game includes sound effects and a moving background.

why the project is useful

This project helps beginners:

- Understand how to create a window and game loop using Pygame.
- Learn how gravity, collisions, and events work in games.
- Practice dividing a game into smaller tasks like drawing, movement, input, and scoring.
- Use problem-solving skills by researching each part of the game (e.g., pipes, jump logic).
- Gain hands-on experience with Python through a fun and interactive project.

How users can get started with the project

To start this project, I followed these steps:

1. **Choose the Game Idea:**
    
    I decided to make a Flappy Bird game, which includes a bird, background, and pipes that the bird must fly through.
    
2. **Break it into parts:**
    
    I separated the game into 5–6 parts:
    
    - Set up the game window.
    - Draw the bird (a shape or image).
    - Add gravity and make the bird jump with a key press.
    - Draw moving pipes with gaps.
    - Detect collisions between the bird and pipes.
    - Add score and game over screen.
3. **Research each part:**
    
    I researched each step on YouTube and asked AI (like ChatGPT) to help me understand and write the code.
    
4. **Write and test the code:**
    
    I wrote each part one by one, tested it, and connected them into a working game.
